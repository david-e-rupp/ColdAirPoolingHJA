# Mean monthly temperature inversion frequency with inner 95% confidence interval
# Nighttime = period beginning 4 hours after sunset and ending 4 hours after sunrise on unobstructed horizontal surface
# Daytime = period beginning 4 hours after sunrise and ending 4 hours after sunset on unobstructed horizontal surface
# NCEP NCAR R1 = NCEP NCAR Reanalysis 1 (Kalnay et al. 1996)
# RS02 = Reference Stand 2; RS04 = Reference Stand 4 (Daly and McKee 2016)
# PRIMET = Primary meteorological station; VANMET = Vanilla Leaf meteorological station (Daly and McKee 2019)
# LLT = Lower Lookout transect; ULT = Upper Lookout transect (Daly 2017)
# Relative_freq = Relative inversion frequency (fraction)
# 025CL = 2.5th percentile of confidence limit of relative frequency
# 975CL = 97.5th percentile of confidence limit of relative frequency
# 975CL = 97.5th percentile of confidence limit of relative frequency
# 975CL = 97.5th percentile of confidence limit of relative frequency
# CLEAR_SKY_SOLAR = Monthly mean estimated clear sky insolation (Watts per square meter)
# CLOUDINESS_INDEX = Monthly mean estimated daily cloudiness index (unitless: megajoules per square meter per day divided by megajoules per square meter per day)
# Nighttime inversion frequency
