SUMMARY
The dataset provided along with this readme file supports the analysis in Rupp et al. (2020). The dataset consists of 7 comma-delimited (.csv) text files, and 109 animated graphics in PDF format.  The csv files are named as follows:
1. Rupp_et_al_2020_temperature_and_light_hja.csv
2. Rupp_et_al_2020_meteorological_variables.csv
3. Rupp_et_al_2020_station_coordinates_hja.csv
4. Rupp_et_al_2020_hourly_inversion_stats_Fig2.csv
5. Rupp_et_al_2020_monthly_inversion_stats_Fig3.csv
6. Rupp_et_al_2020_mlr_relative_importance_Fig9.csv
7. Rupp_et_al_2020_brt_relative_importance_FigS2.csv

There are two types of graphics presented in the animated graphics.
The first type consists of 56 animations of hourly temperature at the Lower Lookout Transect (LLT) and Upper Lookout Transect (ULT), north-facing (nf) and south-facing (sf) sides, plus other meteorological data.
These files use the following naming convection:
1-56. TTT_aa_hourly_YYYR.pdf,
where "TTT" refers to the transect name (LLT or ULT), "aa" refers to the transect aspect (nf or sf), and "YYYY" refers to the year (2005 - 2018).

The second type consists of hourly temperature profiles (elevation vs. temperature) at the LLT and ULT, plus other meteorological data.
These files use the following naming convection:
1-53. TvsElev_hourly_YYYY_MMM.pdf,
where "YYYY" refers to the year (2005 - 2018) and "MMM" refers to the 3 consecutive months (JFM = January thought March; AMJ = April through June; JAS = July through September; OND = October through December).

This dataset was derived from the following existing datasets: Daly (2020), Daly and McKee (2019a; 2019b), Hersbach et al. (2020), and (Kalnay et al., 1996).
