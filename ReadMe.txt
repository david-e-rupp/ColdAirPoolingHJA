Temperature Gradients and Inversions in a Forested Cascade Range Basin: Data Release

The dataset provided along with this readme file supports the analysis in Rupp et al. (202x).  The dataset consists of 7 comma-delimited text files, named as follows:

1. temperature_and_light_hja.csv
2. meteorological_variables.csv
3. station_coordinates_hja.csv
4. hourly_inversion_stats_Fig2.csv
5. monthly_inversion_stats_Fig3.csv
6. mlr_relative_importance_Fig9.csv
7. brt_relative_importance_FigS2.csv

This dataset was derived from the following existing datasets: Daly (2017), Daly and McKee (2016; 2019), and (Kalnay et al., 1996).

Users of this dataset should cite Rupp (202x) and acknowledge the original data sources. 

Suggested acknowledgment of original data sources:
Field data (Daly 2017; Daly and McKee 2016; 2019) were provided by the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest and Long Term Ecological Research program, administered cooperatively by the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, and the Willamette National Forest, and supported by the National Science Foundation (Andrews Forest LTER7 DEB-1440409).
NCEP NCAR Reanalysis data (Kalnay et al., 1996) were provided by the NOAA/OAR/ESRL Physical Sciences Division (Boulder, Colorado, USA; https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html). 
ERA5 reanalysis data (Hersback et al., 2020) were provided by the the Copernicus Climate Change Service Climate Data Store (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu).
