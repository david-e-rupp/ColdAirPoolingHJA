# Coordinates and elevations of sensors at H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest used in Rupp et al. (202x). Temperature Gradients and Inversions in a Forested Cascade Range Basin: Synoptic- to Local-Scale Controls. J. Geophys. Res. Atmos. x(x). xx-xx. doi:...
# See Rupp et al. (202x) for description of data sources and processing steps.
# File created 2020-02-21 by David E. Rupp (david.rupp@oregonstate.edu).
# Spheroid is WGS84.
# LLT = Lower Lookout transect; ULT = Upper Lookout transect. Numbers following LLT and ULT give the sensor ID.
# PRIMET = Primary meteorological station; VANMET = Vanilla Leaf meteorological station; RS02 = Reference Stand 2; RS04 = Reference Stand 4.
# Column: Short name - Description
# 1: NAME - Sensor identifier
# 2: LAT - Latitude (decimal degrees north)
# 3: LON - Longitude (decimal degrees east)
# 4: ELEVATION - Elevation (meters above mean sea level)
