# Values for Figure 2 in Rupp et al. (202x). Temperature Gradients and Inversions in a Forested Cascade Range Basin: Synoptic- to Local-Scale Controls. J. Geophys. Res. Atmos. x(x). xx-xx. doi:...
# File created 2020-10-16 by David E. Rupp (david.rupp@oregonstate.edu).
# Mean temperature inversion frequency by hour of day and month with 2.5th and 97.5th percentile confidence limits
# RS02 = Reference Stand 2; RS04 = Reference Stand 4 (Daly and McKee 2016)
# PRIMET = Primary meteorological station; VANMET = Vanilla Leaf meteorological station (Daly and McKee 2019)
# LLT = Lower Lookout transect; ULT = Upper Lookout transect (Daly 2017)
# Hour = Hour of day (PST).
# RS04-RS02
# Relative frequency (fraction)
